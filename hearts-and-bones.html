        Additionally, I launched a survey to allow us to reach more people.

        <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Current competitors are either too complex or not focusing on travel at all. This gives us a clear niche to position our app in as a simple points tracking solution focused on travel points and miles, with an aesthetically pleasing UI that adheres to Apple’s HIG standards. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-content-text">
        <h3>Onboarding User Flow</h3>
        <p>A lot of the competitors I analyzed had very cumbersome onboarding processes. As a user, you often don’t want to commit to signing up for an app or service before trying it. This made it a priority for the onboarding to be as simple as possible and having the Sign Up be completely optional.</p>
