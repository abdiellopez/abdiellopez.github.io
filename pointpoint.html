        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with coming up with a concept for a mobile app that could help travelers. I identified the problem space and conducted research of the pain points travelers experienced. The final result is an app that aids travelers in keeping track of their rewards points for different airlines. </p>

    <div id="user-research" class="project-content-text double-col">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>For the research, I conducted interviews with people who fit our target audience. The target audience were people who: travel often, use third-party travel apps to book flights, are in their 20s - mid 30s, and have busy schedules. The interviews consisted of 10 - 13 questions about their flight booking habits and other experiences they’ve had with online booking services and apps. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-content-text">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Booking flights is usually an arduous process for most. Even with all the tools that are currently out there to help alleviate the frustrations associated with booking said flights, it can still be a daunting process that ultimately leaves users unhappy with their purchase. I set out to find out what users look for when booking flights, from the moment they get to their assigned gate to the moment they get off the plane. </p>

        <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Current competitors are either too complex or not focusing on travel at all. This gives us a clear niche to position our app in as a simple points tracking solution focused on travel points and miles, with an aesthetically pleasing UI that adheres to Apple’s HIG standards. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-content-text">
        <h3>Onboarding User Flow</h3>
        <p>A lot of the competitors I analyzed had very cumbersome onboarding processes. As a user, you often don’t want to commit to signing up for an app or service before trying it. This made it a priority for the onboarding to be as simple as possible and having the Sign Up be completely optional.</p>
