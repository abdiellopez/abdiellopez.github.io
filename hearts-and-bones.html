        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>In order to gain useful insights of our target users, I conducted user interviews over Zoom. The people interviewed were people who either had adopted from a pet rescue in the past or had considered doing so recently.
        
        Additionally, I launched a survey to allow us to reach more people.

        <p>Rebecca, a young busy professional who lives alone, wants to adopt a dog but has some apprehension about applying online because they want to put their limited time and effort into applying for a dog from a trustworthy and reliable rescue. <b>How might we facilitate the adoption process in a way that also builds trust in the rescue? </b></p>
