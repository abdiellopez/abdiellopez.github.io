        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>In order to gain useful insights of our target users, I conducted user interviews over Zoom. The people interviewed were people who either had adopted from a pet rescue in the past or had considered doing so recently.
        
        Additionally, I launched a survey to allow us to reach more people.
